# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

Conway's Game of Life made in Python using the library Pygame

## [For those who don't know Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970
The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state. The only interaction with the game is by creating the initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## Rules
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
